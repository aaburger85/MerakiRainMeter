# MerakiRainMeter
![MerakiSkinExample](/MerakiSkinExample.png)
This is a rainmeter skin built to provide information on Wi-Fi connectivity, IP info, as well as any info on Meraki device connectivity. 
This skin leverages python3 to operate and uses a mixture of netsh commands, as well as polling the meraki device local status page for connectivity data. If there is not a wifi adapter, this skin will still pull info from any Meraki devices that are in line from the client to the internet. 

Requirements:
1. Rainmeter version 4.3 or newer
2. Python3 installed in PATH
